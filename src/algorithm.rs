        Summarized from the paper;

        Exponential forgetting curve model of memory
        Recall m(t) of item after review is 1.0, m(t) decays with forgetting rate n(t)

            m(t) = exp( -n(t) * (t - t_last_review) )

        Estimated forgetting rate changes based on correct or failed recall.
            Correct recall:
                n(t + dt) = (1 - alpha) * n(t)
            Failed recall:
                n(t + dt) = (1 + beta) * n(t)

        The reviewing intensity is then given by:
            u(t) = q^(-0.5) * (1 - m(t))

        Perfect recall m(t) = 1 results in rate of review of 0.
        Forgotten recall m(t) = 0 results in review events at rate q^(-0.5) per unit time.

        In the paper, this is then transformed from rate-of-reviewing to next-review-time with a
        thinning algorithm.
